        <h1>
          Reflection
        </h1>

        <p>
          While developing the consent protocol, I wanted to emphasize making
          the terms very easy and clear for any user to be able to agree to or
          reject. The user is also able to revoke their agreement at any point
          in the process, which was also very important that it was not a final
          decision, and that the user could rethink their consent. While
          designing an unconventional camera, I thought a lot about the ways in
          which we can capture ourselves: enhance, hide, and distort our
          reality. While cameras used to capture the truth, they are now a tool
          used to control reality. Glissant says in his assertion on Opactiy:
          "This same opacity is also the force that drives every community: the
          thing that would bring us together forever anel make us permanently
          distinctive. Widespread consent to specifie opacities is the most
          straightforward equivalent of nonbarbarism. We clamor for the right to
          opacity for everyone. The process of learning about incorporating a
          consentful practice to my camera got me to reflect on all the ‘terms
          of service’ that I agreed to without fully reading the terms, and all
          the things that I interact with online without consent. It seems that
          the internet space was built with consent as an afterthought. The
          digital world is a consistent mining of information that sometimes
          feel like we have very little authority and agency over. But learning
          about consent in the digital and internet space also brought up issues
          that relate to the physical space. That how we build and nurture
          digital spaces should be guided by similar principles of safety as we
          do physical spaces. In a world increasingly moving into the digital
          sphere, consent should be at the center of how software and interfaces
          are created.
        </p>
        <!--    <p>
          This gets us to reflect on the fact that we all have the right to
          become visible in our own ways. Even if it's uniform, it's still a
          right. And the way we are living in the virtual world through our
          cameras which are giving us visbitliy, we can control how we are seen
          and at least who we become in this virtual world.
        </p>
        <h1>
          Other Camera Concepts To Develop
        </h1>
        <p>
          1- Censorship: A camera that addresses the ways in which a woman's
          body is censored on social apps by putting limitations on what a woman
          should not be showing of her body. A camera that directly pixelates
          her breasts as a commentary on how Instagram censors any image showing
          nipples
        </p>
        <p>
          2- Lighting creates an ambiance that can impact and affect our mood.
          It can change the way we feel about a space. This camera would
          recreate the lighting effects of a party so as to change people’s
          environment while they are stuck in the same place due to quarantine.
          It is an invitation to create a new ambiance in the same environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          3- How can camera filters change the way we perceive ourselves and
          others? This camera detects the time of day and reveals an icon
          depending on the hour. The icon would be coffee mug for the morning,
          or fried brain in the afternoon as a way for people to understand the
          time of day the subject is in.
        </p>
        <p>
          4- A camera that shows the unseens spirits that fill our space.
