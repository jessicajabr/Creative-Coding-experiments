        'Head in between two time zones'
      </h1>

      <p>
        This experimental clock depicts how my brain thinks about time. It's
        split between two time zones just as my heart and brain feel. The shape
        in the middle represents my heart and the way it rotates represents the
        time passing; however, when I'm thinking about a certain timezones, I'm
        always in the opposite one. Clicking the mouse in timezone A (left)
        lights up time zone B, and the more I click the denser it becomes.
        Similarly, clicking on time zone B lights up time zone A. This mechanism
        represents the amount of times I think about the other time zone and the
        energy it takes to do that. I track two time zones whenever I'm in touch
        with my family or thinking about my home country on the other side of
        the world.

      <!-- 3. Design Process -->
      <h1>
        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        I began by ideating and brainstorming 3 different ways of tracking time.
        Considering that “time” is moving forward in all three. I created 3
        design sketches shown below.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <!-- below width and height refers to the dimensions of your sketch-->

        ></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>
        The first sketch, shown above, portrays how time moved in between time
        zones, for me, for two years. The yellow parts of the sketch represent
        the main time zone which I lived in. The blue parts represent the time
        zones which I was traveling to. There's a pattern of going back and
        forth to the country I lived in. The idea here is to track time in
        seconds and have it translated to months for quicker viewing. As time
        moves sections light up. The canvas is split into two zones vertically.
      </p>

        ></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>
        The second sketch, shown above, also divides the canvas into two with the addition of
        a brain in the middle, when hovering over part A (left Y zon) of the
        canvas the brain turns yellow, portraying where my head's at. Same
        applies to when hovering over part B, the brain turns blue.
      </p>

        My third is more complicated than the previous two; it mixes several
        functions. 2 brainstorming sketches show above. I started off by splitting the canvas vertically in half to
        display two time zones. Then as time begins moving forward, zone A (left
        side) lights up from 7:00 AM till 11:59 PM of the same day and then
        becomes dark from 12:00 AM till 6:59 AM the next day. Same applies to
        zone B, reversly. Since I'm comparing between time zones where the
        difference in time is 7 hours, there is an overlap of the time where I
        am awake, in time zone A at the same time people are awake in time zone
        B. I decided to make this overlap 11 hours. My other feature in the
        third sketch is having the brain light up in yellow when time is rolling
        in zone A, and in green when two time zones overlap, and lastly in black
        when time is rolling in zone B. Noting that, the way rolling time is
        portraid in timezones when people are awake is through the coloring of
        the canvas vertically as time progresses. I ended up combining a bit of
        the 2nd and 3rd ideas to execute my sketch. It passes my message along
        in the simplist and my most complicated philosophy of time.

        <h1>
          Reflection
        </h1>

        <p>
          "Head in between two time zones" represents my own interpretation of
          time. Whether it being an individual or a nation, it is their setup of
          their rules for time and running their lives. I would say that I have
          my own rythms but always trying to adapt to surrounding timepieces and
          schedules because of the nature of work that I had done in the past 10
          years and personal relationships with individuals who don’t live in
          the same time zone. It divides the brain and emotions into two, it’s
          like living in between two lives simultaneously. Biases in data train
          algorithms to become biased, a topic of conversation in Design for
          this Century course which is a very apparent topic today. We normalize
          what we perceive as time and time over and over again. Cultures and
          beliefs normalize or alienize and this is what we know pre-tech. Just
          as humanity functioned before tech, its experience of time continuous
          with tech. However, paces are different in different parts of the
          world & I experienced it before I moved to NYC. Algorithms can be
          compared to the butterfly effect where one thing leads to the next and
          this is what puts certain groups of people in a more advance place
          which we perceive as the race. Race to technology, race to
          advancement, race to ‘bettering’ humanity.
