            This is the game of my life where every scene details the hoops and
            challenges I have had to overcome and face in order to set myself on
            the track and direction of the life I want to live. Scene 1 shows
            all the challenging obstacles that I as a lesbian Lebanese woman
            have to face in society: overcoming homophobia, the patriarchy,
            societal expectations, and in my culture the added burden of
            marriage. In addition to all of these, in order to have a decent and
            free life, I have also had to overcome physical borders, and mental
            borders that chain me to a specific place or idea. Scene 2: I have
            set myself on a journey to become borderless, detached of place,
            practice, and a set way of being. In order to become borderless and
            free, I have to fight off all the imposed ways in which society and
            policy tend to frame me, box me into one thing or the other, make me
            smaller than I feel or know I can become. Here I am dodging all
            impositions that are forced on me. And finally, in Scene 3, I arrive
            at a place where I am reaping the rewards of overcoming the
            demanding nature of our world, and that to me is reflected in
            gaining money and power to become untouchable in my difference.

            <p>
              I was excited to begin working on this project, and found the
              prompt exciting: translating my life/story into a game. I found
              that I define myself not by the chains that hold me back but by
              how I overcome them. So I decided to create a game about
              “overcoming”. After sketching out the scenes and then beginning to
              transfer them to code made it clear that the scenes could each be
              a game on their own, and that each could be broken down into
              multiple scenes. However, I wanted to still depict these 3 scenes
              because they contain a narrative arc, a beginning, middle and end.
              Throughout the process of coding, there were things I was so
              excited to incorporate in the game and design but lacked the time
              and expertise to accomplish in time. Working on this game made me
              excited about gamifying social and economic issues in order to
              make them more apparent and in order to dissect them and address
              them in new ways.
