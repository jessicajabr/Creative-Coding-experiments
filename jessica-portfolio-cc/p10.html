          Topic Overview
        </h1>
        <p>
          As the biking culture continues to grow in a city like New York,
          especially with the movement towards greener practice, it is important
          to create maps that carry data that relate to: routes, safety, and
          accidents/incidents about biking. Having more intel into these
          conditions, with about 900,000 New Yorkers regularly riding bikes
          around the city, it allows the city to create better conditions for
          safety: adding routes where there is none, and creating a better
          system to reduce theft and accidents. Bike accidents can be very
          dangerous, and the more bikers are equipped with knowledge and data
          about this issue, the better they can protect themselves and others.
          There has been a serious decrease in cycling risk over the past
          decade, and that is due to increasing safety measures spread around
          the city. Further, having maps that detail biking routes that have
          been integral in keeping cyclists protected from other vehicles is
          crucial. Creating this map that captures the number of incidents
          (theft, crash, unknown) in relation to bike lanes, gives an additional
          look into how these two data points correlate. As cycling becomes more
          and more a mode of commuting, especially seeing a rise during the
          pandemic when taking public transportation was less appealing, I was
          interested to explore how the state of biking/cycling in New York
          City, how equipped the city is and has been. Bicycle theft and
          accidents are also a very common experience in the city, and I wanted
          to overlay this data on top of the map of the city to understand
          better how they are spread out, how often they happen, and whether or
          not bike lanes play a role in shaping the frequency of incidents.

            BikeWise is a place to learn about and report bike crashes, hazards,
            and thefts. This project intends to provide a powerful, universal
            way to access biking incident data for data scientists and
            developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            BikeWise has an open, RESTful API.

            Every day incidents for the past 30 days are committed to
            geojson_data/recent incidents.geojson and all incidents are
            committed to geojson_data/all.geojson. Both are geojson
            FeatureCollections, generated by calling the locations endpoint of
            the API.

            <p>
              This project was very educational in how to approach data in a
              relational way, and to view different data sets in context of each
              other. After researching and further exploring this topic, I found
              that bike routes/lanes help cities that are as dense as New York
              keep their cyclist safe and help maintain the practice of biking
              as a viable and desired mode of transportation. Cycling has many
              benefits that relate to health and the environment, and
              unfortunately it can be a dangerous activity in a high-traffic
              city. About 2 million New Yorkers have chosen biking at least once
              in the past year. In NYC alone, there has been a high increase
              (355) in commuter cycling in comparison to other peer cities
              (16%). About 1800 lane miles of bike lanes were introduced in 2019
              increasing the safety of riding a bike in the city. Female
              commuter cyclists increased four times faster than male commuter
              cyclists over the past couple of years. This information is very
              crucial, and important to view against the data of crashes,
              thefts, and incidents in order to assess the situation and better
              the conditions of cyclists and decrease the number of crashes and
              thefts around the city.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was great learning to pull out data and work with datasets.
              This empowered me with a tool to show disparities and
              discrepencies in certain existing realities. My entire approach to
              this project was applying feminist data principles. My search for
              the API was looking at and challenging what gets counted, and when
              that search yielded no results, I had to pivot for the sake of the
              deadline. I also dug deep in my search in an effort to challenge
              power, and to really look for what seemed to be an unlikely data
              set. It got me thinking about what gets counted, why, and by whom.
              And all these things matter in the search for a dataset. The Be
              Bike Wise dataset is a community led project to protect bikers
              from street harm. I decided to focus on incidents of theft because
              that is a prevailing problem for bikers in cities. Localizing and
              highlighting theft informs bikers and allows them to better
              navigate their surroundings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having publicly available data is a valuable resource which should
              be utilize by technologists, especially when looking at topics
              that could use some visualization.

              Further Reflection on the Process
            </h1>
            <p>
              Finding the right APIs was very difficult. I looked for APIs about
              female-identifying members of the LGBTQ community who are either
              business founders or who work in tech. It was not almost
              impossible to source this data. I then looked into APIs about
              women win general who own small businesses which was available
              through the government. I then pivoted to look at women who study
              science and engineering and wanted to compare that to women who
              are working in science and engineering. I found the search for
              APIs quite challenging since most of what I was interested in
              exploring and visualizing was not available. Data that was not
              easily accessible and in some cases missing altogether. The last
              two APIs that I wanted to work with I found through the Census
              which proved to be a very difficult set to work with. Government
              data sets are very expansive and hold a lot of data. The search
              took up a lot of time as I was nearing the deadline and I really
              wanted to work on a topic that mattered to me. But the search was
              very telling in terms of what data is available and accessible as
              opposed to what is not, and that gap became very interesting.

              I tried working with several concepts and 4 other APIs which lead
              to a dead end after spending time dissecting their data and trying
              to get to the endpoint requests. The process of allocating a
              convenient API and an intersting and valuable topic was very
              challenging and time consuming and the fact that I resorted to
              this topic is satisfying for the time being; however, I will be
              workig with the other API which I found to develop visualizations
              for other topics.
