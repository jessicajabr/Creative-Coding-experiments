        Eddie's Red Watch
      </h1>

      <p>
        In this project I had to draw in code language an object that was
        described to me in plain language. Eddie, my partner in this project,
        described a gift from his sister which he has lost. This gift meant a
        lot to him especially because of its sentimental connection. I
        re-created the object for Eddie in P5.js and I can't wait to see his
        reaction to it.

      <h1>
        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        Designer: Jessica Jabr - Assignment Partner: Eddie Chen - Object
        Description- Color: Strong red, kind of shiny - Material: plastic -
        Additional info: rectangular shaped screen - 2 straps - has 4 buttons on
        its sides - electronic display - shows time on it 11:08 AM - Casio brand
        The object was described to me in plane English language and there
        weren't many specs mentioned on the sizing. The most details about the
        object I had to work with were the color, and shape. I was able to tell
        that the object is a Casio watch and was also able to estimate the model
        which Eddie described. I tried my best to dissect the object in order to
        begin drawing it. I sketched it down on a piece of paper and then began
        transferring my drawing to p5.js. The process of sketching was easy as I
        did a simple design to be able to translate it in code. First I coded
        the screen with its two layers and 4 buttons on its sides, then I
        created the top and bottom straps, then the loop on the bottom strap
        with the details, then the black seal and hook. After that, I created
        the openings on the top strap. I also added the brand which gave it a
        more real look. One of the main reflections in the designing process is
        being able to draw out details and particular twists which make the
        object become closer from the description. Another reflection is jumping
        in between parts of the design to add or remove a certain detail to the
        part of the watch. I did not have all the details sketched but as I
        began drawing on p5js, I started having more ideas on what to add to
        make the watch look more real.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        The more I understand technology and how it gets created, the more I get
        assured that it's not neutral. For the past couple of years there's been
        constant attempts at neutralizing it and those attempts live on when
        better tech is created. People who are aware of the bias in creating and
        using technology are taking action; therefore, technology is not 100%
        biased nor 100% neutral. Google map's and other apps pro-active roles in
        hiding parts of the truth is a definite bias in technology. In addition,
        the creation of maps on paper was also biased and so the ones who
        created them had the power of sizing nations and continents. The issue
        lies within the entity creating, the entity telling the story. "Show the
        people as one thing, over and over again, and that is what they become."
        -Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie touches on the danger of the sigle perspetive
        and this is the power of storytelling. One of the single stories for a
        long time has been the women's role in technology. We've come a long way
        in redfining these roles. One of the major issues aside from the roles
        is the inequitable pay. The underlying assumptions are gender and what a
        certain gender is capable or incapable of doing. I had the chance to
        attend The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Technology last year, in
        Orlando and one of the most empowering moments of my life was during
        that event where I decided to change the course of my life. All my life
        I had been the recipient and experienced the inequity in the tech
        industry so I decided to start creating and take back the power of
        technology. Similarly, the process I went through in making this sketch
        reflects how technology isn't neutral and that there's sometimes a
        single story that leads to an outcome. When I heard Eddie's description,
        I assumed a model and drew a shape accordingly and my final sketch is
        the result of both the description I heard and my assumptions;
        therefore, this story isn't single. It has two perspectives: input from
        the owner and assumptions of the maker.
