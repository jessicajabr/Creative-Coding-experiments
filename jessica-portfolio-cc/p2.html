        PROTECTOR
      </h1>

      <p>
        In this project, I explored creating a simple generator that will create
        multiple variations of the form through mouse interactions.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        Designing the "Protector" required to main steps: 1) Ideation and
        drawing the sketches of biggest and smallest form. 2) Translating the
        sketch in p5js and make it change size and form. The Protector is a
        shield that follows the mouse to protect and cover the user. It is meant
        to change colors, just like the changing weather when prompted by the
        user through a mouse press. First I started off by declaring my
        variables and drew a full traingle sequence which I then played with and
        changed to become the "shield" it is now. I didn't intend on making the
        shield, its idea developed throughout the coding process. I played with
        the movement and was finally able to make it move and change size as the
        mouse moves. I declared more variable pertaining to the background to
        make it more interesting for the viewer.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        Ruha Benjamin’s race after technology is very enlightening and the
        chapter about Robots and AI paints the perfect picture with the utmost
        balanced conclusion on the future of tech bias. It should be a
        controlled medium, an intentional and pro-active force to make the
        technology un-biased and not racist. Human beings reduced to parameters
        is when what a human stands for is a set of tags collected from their
        behaviour, habits, likes, and online interactions. This is clear in the
        “governing without a mandate” example, where people’s lives are being
        shaped by automated decisions and reach the point where they have very
        little say in how they are governed. Human beings reduced to variables
        is the circumstances they are born in and the make up of who they are.
        Whether racially or socio-economically, the variables in their lives are
        what make up the judgement on how they are treated. Health,
        intelligence, criminality, employment are all learning factors in the
        system they are in. The form I ended up creating developed throughout
        the process. I discovered that I'm able to conceptualize and create cool
        things on p5js. not necessarily what I had planned to do but ended up
        doing something cooler. Making an object move and react to prompts was
        hard to do. Assigning variable and thinking of the logic that will make
        them interact is harder than I expected. Whatever we feed the machine
        and make it do is our power in manipulating technology.
