            How many times do I look out the window in a week? Why? What was I
            doing? Most of the time I would be sitting on my desk facing the
            screen, which I have positioned infront of the window in my living
            room I would look out of the window when the weather is nice outside
            and I can't go out because I have a lot of work to do for my masters
            program. I compared the number of times I looked out in relation to
            if I had left the house that day or not.

          Reflection

        <p>
          What I learnt about myself through the process of self-tracking
        </p>
        <p>
          I came to the realization that I would look more outside when I
          haven't gone out during a given day. After tracking my data I became
          more aware of the need of going out and enjoying a sunny day and to
          try to make time whenever possible. The process of tracking was
          rigourous as I had to compile sets of data during four hours and
          instantly on a sheet of paper. Data visualization plays an important
          role in experessing, exploring, and reflecting on results. It is also
          a weapon where we can show a certain lack or addition. I am inspired
          by a data visualizer called Mona Chalabi as she's been doing amazing
          work in the field on various topics from an intersectional feminist
          point of view. "After doing this project and studying Feminist Data
          concepts, especially principle #7. "Show Your Work" which stresses to
          Make Labor Visible. The work of data science, like all work in the
          world, is the work of many hands. Data feminism makes this labor
          visible so that it can be recognized and valued. An interesting aspect
          I learned about is when releasing a data product to the public, we
          tend not to credit the many hands who perform this work. We often cite
          the source of the dataset, and the names of the people who designed
          and implemented the code and graphic elements. But we rarely dig
          deeper to discover who created the data in first place, who collected
          the data and processed them for use, and who else might have labored
          to make creations like​. ​To put it more simply, it’s not a
          coincidence that much of the work that goes into designing a data
          product—visualization, algorithm, model, app—remains invisible and
          uncredited.​ ​In our capitalist society, we tend to value work that we
          can see. This is the result of a system in which the cultural worth of
          any particular form of work is directly connected to the price we pay
          for it; because a service costs money, we recognize its larger value.
          But more often than not, the reverse also holds true: we fail to
          recognize the larger value of the services we get for free. Another
          key takeaway is that the term invisible labor has come to encompass
          the various forms of labor, unwaged, underwaged, and even waged, that
          are rendered invisible because they take place inside of the home,
          because they take place out of sight, or because they lack physical
          form altogether.

          What was gained / lost through the process of data visualization?

          2- Lighting creates an ambiance that can impact and affect our mood.
          It can change the way we feel about a space. This camera would
          recreate the lighting effects of a party so as to change people’s
          environment while they are stuck in the same place due to quarantine.
          It is an invitation to create a new ambiance in the same environment.

          3- How can camera filters change the way we perceive ourselves and
          others? This camera detects the time of day and reveals an icon
          depending on the hour. The icon would be coffee mug for the morning,
          or fried brain in the afternoon as a way for people to understand the
          time of day the subject is in.
