        <p>
          I wanted to show that Lebanon has become a sink hole, and the sink
          hole simile we use when we speak about the Lebanese politicians and
          them entering the garbage sink hole of history. My sketch shows the
          revolving sink hole which keeps drawing itself and drawing history
          over and over again by erasing and re-drawing. Here when un-clicked,
          the hidden message becomes hidden again and only shows back when
          clicked. Politicians in Lebanon, rarely change and the corrupt ones
          i.e the thives keep coming with every click; it's like a new history
          is being written but the end result is the same. My main message for
          the Lebanese people is to revolt because of all the corruption which
          has been caused by the Lebanese politicians who are thieves. Thieves
          of stealing tax-payer's money instead of reforming and developing the
          country. They have been doing it for so many years that the Lebanese
          people have lost hope, even after revolting in 2019, they have lost
          hope again. And my message comes to remind them of the corruption and
          the need to keep revolting and not to stop. I had to hide the object
          that I'm attacking which is the politicians because of the
          surveillance in Lebanon and the attemps from the ruling government to
          limit the freedome of speech. Unless given directions, not everyone
          can uncover the message and using steganography is the perfect
          technique for this piece. My message afterall is: No matter how hard
          you try to hide the truth it'll always show, they are thieves. It will
          stay hightlighted in white showing over any noise, that's trying to
          seal it.

          The first starting point for this assignment was brainstorming on the
          topic I'd like to highlight. Naturally, I'm inclined to talk about the
          corruption in Lebanon, and the corrupt politicians there who are
          responsible the country's economic failure for the past 30 years. I
          used the Moir√© Pattern inspired by Nazia Fakhruddin works
          https://medium.com/@naziafakhruddin/the-mysterious-moir%C3%A9-pattern-49d797897355.
          The revolving sink-hole served my purpose well, and this lead me to
          hiding one of the messages in the the repurposed Moire pattern. The
          hidden message is a string: 'POLITICIANS'; as seen in the screenshot
          on the left.
        </p>

        <p>
          I incorporated the moire pattern and anaglyph in separate parts of the
          sketch. As seen in the images below, the words "ARE Thieves" show when
          the mouse is clicked over the area they're in as I colored them white,
          same as the background; so when the mouse draws under them, we see
          them better from the contrast in colors.
        </p>

        <p>
          I used the blendMode to get the contrast in colors when the mouse is
          pressed: [if (mouseIsPressed) { blendMode(DIFFERENCE)] I used the
          combination from Xin's Youtube tutorial
          https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDn7y4nWekE&feature=youtu.be
          blendMode() + Loops - Anaglyph Illusion
        </p>

        <p>
          I added rotate to the drawing with angles that behave differently
          throughout. for "REVOLT" the angle rotates at [angle += 0.5].
        </p>
        for "Corruption" it's being drawn over and over again with the drawing
        of the sinkhole and rotating at [rotate(10 + angle)]
        <p>
          I also had some lines being drawn to give more animation effects
          [line( i + mouseX, 100, i + mouseX, 150)] when the mouse is hovering
          over the white area, we can see the lines being drawn.

            <p>
              Interests and identity are major factors on what we design.
              Lebanon is part of my identity and the corruption there lead ot
              the deterioration of the socio-ecnomic conditions I lived in for
              30 years. My unpleasing journey there, was a factor in me creating
              this piece. I like pop art, aggressive animation, and smart
              messaging and I hope that this sketch satisfies those traits. I am
              looking forward to exploring more social/economic issues that I
              relate to as I'd like my work to have a purpose. I aspire to make
              my style bold and different by always having a strong message,
              crafting a strong concept around it, and incorporating the
              technology that makes most sense with it.
