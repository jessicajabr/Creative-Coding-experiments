        Design Process
      </h1>
      <p>
        I picked the astronaut's figure and sketched it then shared it with the
        rest of the group. I ended up using part 2 of the body to complete my
        exquisite corpse. Part 1 is Winnie's head from the sketch she drew of
        herself and part 3 is Leah's Tinky Winky from Teletubbies legs. I cut
        each of the images and used the parts needed for my figure. Then
        uploaded them to P5JS. I wanted the final outcome to be a whole new
        well-blended person & figure. The final outcome represents a complete
        holistic fourth version of a human.
      </p>

      <p>
        My figure's story: The person behind the astronaut can be anyone. The
        astronaut clothing covers the person behind the suit. I picked the
        astronaut since it's the person who's able to live in the future, a
        future that is genderless. It would be interesting to see how the
        astronaut could be animated from different perspectives and who would
        they turn out to be.

        Winnie Zhai Story: my story: this illustration is one of my illustration
        series called “Miami trip” and I did three drawings for me and my
        friends after I traveled back from Miami last November . We went to a
        furniture exhibition I really like the look I wore that day. It was a
        precious moment in my life since that was our first road trip after
        graduation.

        Leah Wang Story Teletubbies: The story of my figure: Teletubbies was one
        of my favorite cartoons back when I was little. Tinky-Winky is one of my
        favorites babies out of all of them. I loved their strawberry smoothie
        and it is still one of my favorite drinks till today. I remember missing
        classes because I was too addicted to the show.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        Fashion, uniforms and suits are created for a certain gender, and many
        people subscribe to these gender norms based on their surrounding
        environment. My clothes were influenced by a certain stereotype in the
        Business & Tech industry, and there was a social price to pay if I
        dressed otherwise, especially given the geographical setting I lived in.
        I connected this concept to the astronaut and teletubbies, where I could
        be in an astronaut suit and my legs looking like teletubbies' and form a
        whole new persona detached from gender norms. Preconceived perceptions
        of who is behind this type of role, suit, profession has no place in my
        sketch -- this sketch screams’ you can be who you want to be.’
