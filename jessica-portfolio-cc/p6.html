        <!-- 3. write a short description to describe what the work is about -->
        <p>
          This is a satirical camera that detects your bad angles i.e. when
          getting too close to camera, or when the face is partially out of the
          camera's frame. It alerts you visually by turning green with a stop
          sign. The image goes back to normal when you get back to an
          ‘acceptable’ position. It calls you to maintain your distance to
          maintain your image. This is a commentary on a virtually saturated
          world where our image is subject to more policing by ourselves and the
          technology. It alerts us to adhere to ‘beauty ideas’ in our daily and
          domestic interactions with one another through the camera. Since the
          start of the pandemic, we have increased our usage of video calling as
          a replacement for physically existing with one another. And while we
          were used to communicating naturally through our face and body, we are
          now forced to fit within a rectangle, a frame that enables control,
          elimination, and intrusion.

        <h1>
          Design Process
        </h1>
        <p>
          I used the clm tracker tool for face detection by Audun Mathias
          Øygard; this tool provided me with precise tracking of facial features
          via Constrained Local Models, where I was able to specify detected
          points on the face contour and work on controlling my camera based on
          their movement within the frame.
        </p>

        <p>
          // create a new clmtrackr object
        </p>
        <p>
          // initialize the object
        </p>
        <p>
          // start tracking the video element
        </p>
        <p>
          Then added let positions = tracker.getCurrentPosition(); which updates
          the tracker with current positions
        </p>
        <p>
          Then made the connecting vectors which show in the image below
          disappear, in addition to the points and numbers indicating positions.
        </p>

        <p>
          To refine the detection, I selected 5 points for positions and added
          those positions in the array for each. I used if statement and arrays
          with relational and logical operators. On the other hand specified
          points in the canvas in case the face detector point crosses, it
          triggers the camera to flash.
        </p>

              <p>
                4.1 in angle one: where eyes are so close; therefore head gets

              <p>
                5. in angle two: where face gets out of the frame to the left or

              <p>

              <p>
                7. screen lights up in green

              <p>
                8. When face is back in frame, screen stops being green and

                Reflection
              </h1>

              <p>
                While designing an unconventional camera, I thought a lot about
                the ways in which we can capture ourselves: enhance, hide, and
                distort our reality. While cameras used to capture the truth,
                they are now a tool used to control reality. Glissant says in
                his assertion on Opactiy: "This same opacity is also the force
                that drives every community: the thing that would bring us
                together forever anel make us permanently distinctive.
                Widespread consent to specifie opacities is the most
                straightforward equivalent of nonbarbarism. We clamor for the
                right to opacity for everyone."
              </p>
              <p>
                This gets us to reflect on the fact that we all have the right
                to become visible in our own ways. Even if it's uniform, it's
                still a right. And the way we are living in the virtual world
                through our cameras which are giving us visbitliy, we can
                control how we are seen and at least who we become in this
                virtual world.
              </p>
              <h1>
                Other Camera Concepts To Develop
              </h1>
              <p>
                1- Censorship: A camera that addresses the ways in which a
                woman's body is censored on social apps by putting limitations
                on what a woman should not be showing of her body. A camera that
                directly pixelates her breasts as a commentary on how Instagram
                censors any image showing nipples
              </p>
              <p>
                2- Lighting creates an ambiance that can impact and affect our
                mood. It can change the way we feel about a space. This camera
                would recreate the lighting effects of a party so as to change
                people’s environment while they are stuck in the same place due
                to quarantine. It is an invitation to create a new ambiance in
                the same environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                3- How can camera filters change the way we perceive ourselves
                and others? This camera detects the time of day and reveals an
                icon depending on the hour. The icon would be coffee mug for the
                morning, or fried brain in the afternoon as a way for people to
                understand the time of day the subject is in.
              </p>
              <p>
                4- A camera that shows the unseens spirits that fill our space.
